{% img left http://www.brucalipto.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vmware.gif VMware logo %} With the release of VMware Player 4.0.1 (as noted here) VMware has also released new VMware Tools version 8.8.1. If, for some reasons, you need to get them directly (and not from VMware Player) you can grab them from here: [http://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/player/4.0.1/528992/](http://softwareupdate.vmware.com/cds/vmw-desktop/player/4.0.1/528992/)
