[{% img left /images/2012/07/Raspi_Colour_R_71x86.png Raspberry Pi logo %}](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) Unless you live under a rock 
you should know about the existence of the Raspberry Pi, the ARM GNU/Linux box that costs only $25! It is a technological and economical
marvel smaller than a packet of cigarettes. I just received my sample and from now on I will write about my experience with this nice gadget.

## First things first
{% img right /images/2012/07/RaspberryPi_barebone.jpg Raspberry Pi motherboard %} The first thing to do is to start the Raspberry Pi: 
for 25$ you get only the barebone board you can see in the picture on the right. For a somewhat complete list of supported peripherals you can take a look at [Elinux](http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals#Notes) site.

For my raspberry I then used:

* Samsung 8GB Class 10 SDHC - Model code: MB-SP8GA/EU
* Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 (mouse and keyboard)
* Linksys by Cisco WUSB100 Wireless N USB Adapter (for wi-fi network)

For the operating system I opted for [Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) minimal image you can find [here](http://www.linuxsystems.it/2012/06/raspbian-wheezy-armhf-raspberry-pi-minimal-image/). 
Install it on the SD following the instructions reported there... I had no problems, everything was clear and it worked fine.

The only problem found so far is the wireless usb key that is not working as expected... this is going to be material for the next installment.
