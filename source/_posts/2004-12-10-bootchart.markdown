                        This is the bootchart of my own PC at work running Mandrake Linux 10.1                         Official Edition.


## Metodology


I followed all the directions listed in the                         [                             Mandrakelinux Development Community                         ](http://qa.mandriva.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BootTimeOptimisation)                         and here follow the chart.
